# Privacy Policy – Dental Appointment

**Effective date:** January 21, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how DentalAppointmentApp (“the App”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect and process the following information:

- **Account information:** email address and authentication identifiers required for login and registration.
- **Profile information:** first name, last name, and user role (e.g., user or owner) stored in the “profiles” table.
- **Appointments data:** appointment time, selected service, appointment status (e.g., booked or cancelled), and related identifiers.
- **Services data (viewing only):** service name, duration, price, and description.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- create and manage your account and authenticate your session,
- provide core functionality (view services, create, edit, and cancel appointments),
- route users to the correct experience based on role (user or owner),
- maintain application security and prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. Where Your Data Is Stored

The App uses Supabase as a backend service. Your data is stored in a Supabase-hosted database and authentication system.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your personal information with third parties except:

- when required by law, legal process, or governmental request,
- to protect the rights, security, and integrity of the App and its users.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service.

When a user deletes their account, all associated personal data (including profile and appointments) is permanently deleted from the system.

## 6. Account Deletion

The App provides a built-in option to permanently delete your account.

You can delete your account directly within the App by navigating to the user dashboard and selecting **“Delete account”**.  
When you confirm this action, your account and all associated personal data (including profile and appointment records) are permanently removed.

This action is irreversible.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Backend access control rules are enforced to ensure users can only access their own data.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- request access to your personal data,
- request correction of inaccurate data,
- request deletion of your account and associated personal data.

Account deletion can be performed directly within the App as described above.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
