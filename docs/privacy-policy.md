**Effective date:** January 21, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how DentalAppointmentApp (“the App”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

1. Information We Collect

We may collect and process the following information:

Account information: email address and authentication identifiers required for login/registration.

Profile information: first name, last name, and user role (e.g., user/owner) stored in the “profiles” table.

Appointments data: appointment time, service selection, appointment status (e.g., booked/cancelled), and related identifiers.

Services data (viewing): service name, duration, price, and description.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

create and manage your account and authenticate your session,

provide core functionality (view services, create/edit/cancel appointments),

route users to the correct experience based on role (user/owner),

maintain app security and prevent unauthorized access.

3. Where Your Data Is Stored

The App uses Supabase as a backend service. Your data is stored in a Supabase-hosted database and authentication system.

4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your personal information with third parties except:

when required by law, legal process, or governmental request,

to protect the rights, security, and integrity of the App and its users.

5. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. Appointment records may remain stored to preserve history and status tracking.

6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Access control rules are enforced on the backend to restrict access to data (e.g., users can access only their own appointments).

7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

request access to your personal data,

request correction of inaccurate data,

request deletion of your account and associated personal data.
